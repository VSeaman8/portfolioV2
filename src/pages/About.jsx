          <h3>My quick story</h3>
          <p>
            Knowledge has always been a passion for me, evolving from a
            childhood curiosity about how candy was made to sharing life in a
            medieval castle as a reenactor. This passion was reinforced when I
            began working in various library authorities. As part of the library
            team, I <strong>contributed to modernizing our services</strong> by
            being on the help desk, beta testing new services, encouraging
            vulnerable users to engage with the library, and troubleshooting
            technology issues for patrons. It was here that my
            <strong> love for technology blossomed</strong>, as I saw first hand
            how it could provide access to information for everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I needed to move across the country and leave my library job, I
            saw it as the perfect opportunity to pivot into the tech world. I
            enrolled in a <strong>bootcamp where I learned Python</strong> and
            began my coding journey. This experience ignited a deeper passion
            for technology, driving me to explore how I could leverage it to
            help others.
          </p>
          <p>
            {" "}
            From there, I took part in the
            <strong> Digital Future Academy,</strong>
            where
            <strong> I learned what it means to be a software engineer</strong>.
            Immersing myself in the principles of software engineering and
            mastering various coding languages, I am now excited to apply my new
            skills and share my passion for technology and knowledge

          <h3>As a developer</h3>
          <p>
            My coding ethos is centered on
            <strong> versatility, robustness, and clarity</strong>. Initially, I
            build to ensure functionality, making sure the code is clear and
            adheres to the <strong>single responsibility principle</strong> as
            much as possible. I prioritize commenting and organizing the code to
            be welcoming to any collaborator.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Versatility and clarity</strong> are my mantras. I believe
            in creating <strong>sustainable and adaptable code</strong>, aiming
            not just to make it work but to craft it to last and be easily
            managed. Every new project is a welcome opportunity to{" "}
            <strong>expand my abilities through learning and growth</strong>,
            turning each challenge into a chance to broaden my horizons and
            enhance my skills.

          <h3>As a person</h3>
          <p>
            The best way to describe me is <strong>curious</strong>. As someone
            who is <strong>dyslexic</strong>, I approach problems with an
            <strong> outside-the-box mentality</strong> and a curious mindset,
            seeing challenges differently. I break them down into bite-sized
            pieces and craft innovative solutions. The best way to eat an
            elephant, after all, is one bite at a time.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            {" "}
            Driven by curiosity and a thirst for knowledge, I am a{" "}
            <strong>perpetual learner</strong>. My diverse interests include{" "}
            <strong>
              traveling, reading, and playing board and computer games
            </strong>
            . I've also volunteered as a judge for the Wilbur Smith Adventure
            Prize and as an ease-of-use surveyor, ensuring footpaths are
            accessible. These experiences enrich my life and feed into my
            professional development, shaping me into a{" "}
            <strong>well-rounded person</strong>—I like to think of myself as a
            pie chart, not a Pac-Man.

          <h3>As a colleague</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>My collaborative spirit is a core part of who I am</strong>.
            With 15 years of experience as a library officer, I bring a diverse
            set of soft skills that enhance my role as a team member and leader.
            <strong>Empathy</strong> and <strong>dedication</strong> drive me to
            support my colleagues, ensuring we work together smoothly and
            effectively.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            {" "}
            Having overseen volunteers and managed daily operations at two
            libraries, I've honed <strong>leadership</strong> skills that guide
            teams toward shared goals with clarity and enthusiasm.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            I thrive on <strong>flexibility</strong>, adapting seamlessly
            whether working independently or as part of a team. This ability
            ensures consistent productivity and fosters a positive work
            environment. Additionally, my{" "}
            <strong>strong time-management skills</strong> allow me to
            prioritize tasks effectively, ensuring deadlines are met without
            compromising quality.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m always up for discussing books and
            <strong>your go-to for any book recommendation</strong>—it used to
            be one of my favorite activities when I worked at the library.
            Connecting over literature is a great way for me to unwind and
            engage with colleagues beyond work.
